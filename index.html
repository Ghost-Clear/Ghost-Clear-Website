            <p>To enhance your ghosting experience, we have created a group of six devices that seamlessly connect to the Ghost Clear App. From the app you can launch a number of workouts that are all highly customizable. You can also set goals that update according to completed workouts. All workouts are recorded and can be easily viewed to show performance details.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The 6 devices were meticulously crafted for ruggedness, ease of use, and longevity. The devices are used to indicate which corner to ghost to and to detect a swing of a racket. Using new bluetooth low energy technology, the devices automatically pair with the app as soon as you start a workout.</p>
