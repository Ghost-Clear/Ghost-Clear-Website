            <p>To enhance your ghosting experience, we have created a group of six devices that seamlessly connect to the Ghost Clear App. From the app you can launch a number of workouts that are all highly customizable.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The six devices were meticulously crafted for ruggedness, ease of use, and longevity. The devices are used to indicate which corner to ghost to and to detect a swing of a racket. </p>

            <p>The 4 different workouts that you can choose from are the Timed Workout, the Number workout, the Beep test workout, and the Play a Pro workout. Each one can be programed to the intensity of your choice. During the workout,
            the app and the devices will indicate which corner to ghost to using the LEDs on the devices and speaker on the phone.</p>

            <p>In the app, you are able to set goals that you would like to achieve. The View Your Goals screen allow you to closely track your goals and which ones have been achieved. As you complete each workout, the app automatically
